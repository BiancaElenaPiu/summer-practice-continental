# Sudoku Solver
This repository presents a Sudoku application in C# that supports both 9 x9 and 16x16 grid sizes. The project utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to automatically solve puzzles and generate valid new games.
I built a dynamic WinForms interface that programmatically renders the grid and adjusts layouts based on the chosen difficulty level. The system features real-time move validation and a mistake-tracking engine to enhance the user experience
Also, it is implemented a clean Object-Oriented architecture by separating the game logic into dedicated classes for solving, generating, and validating.
